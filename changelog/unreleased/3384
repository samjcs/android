Enhancement: Allow access from document provider preference

Previously, files of ownCloud accounts couldn't be accessed from document
provider or Android native file explorer when there was a lock set in the
app. Now, a new preference has been added to allow the access when the app
is locked, disabled by default so that it's safer for those who don't want
this feature.
